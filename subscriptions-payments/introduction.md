# Subscriptions & Payments Overview

The Subscriptions & Payments module is designed to help your community generate steady revenue while staying true to its purpose. It gives you easy tools to set up different subscription levels, manage how you accept payments, and support long-term community commitment with the Citizenship Program.

## Key Features

1. **Subscription Tiers:**  
   Create multiple support levels (like Bronze, Silver, Gold) so community members can choose how to contribute. Each tier comes with its own set of benefits.

2. **Managing Benefits:**  
   Set up rewards automatically for each subscription tier. This builds a closer connection between the community and its supporters.

3. **Payment Configuration:**  
   Integrate traditional payment methods (such as credit cards and bank transfers) along with blockchain-based tokens. This flexible approach makes it simple for everyone to pay.

4. **Citizenship Program:**  
   Offer a long-term payment plan where members commit over a 3-year period. As they contribute, they accumulate tokens, and once they reach a minimum of 30 tokens, they gain Citizenship status. Citizenship comes with extra rights and exclusive benefits for deeper community involvement.

- **Define Each Tier:**  
  Decide on clear names like Bronze, Silver, and Gold.  
- **List the Benefits:**  
  Describe what perks each tier offers (e.g., access to exclusive content, early event registration, or additional voting power).  
- **Set the Pricing:**  
  Specify the fee per tier. This can be a recurring charge or a token-based contribution.

## Citizenship Program (Configurable Membership)

The Citizenship Program turns your community into an exclusive members club using token gating. Members can join by meeting a set token threshold—say, 30 tokens—by either paying upfront or via a flexible payment plan. For example, a common configuration might set a 3-year plan at €193.67 per month. 

Key features include:
- **Flexible Payment Options:** Choose to pay all at once or spread payments over time.
- **Token Gating:** Only members with the required tokens gain full membership status.
- **Community Vouching & Engagement:** Members can be vouched for by peers, and extra rewards (like Proof of Presence or Sweat) may boost their eligibility.
- **Customizable Criteria:** Adjust the token requirement, payment duration, and additional eligibility rules to perfectly match your community’s needs.

This example is just one way to set up the program—you have complete control over the settings to create a membership structure that works best for your community.
