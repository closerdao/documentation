# Accommodation

## Overview

Closer’s Accommodation module gives regenerative communities a beautiful, intuitive interface to manage all types of stays—from staff and volunteers to guests and glampers. With real-time listings, image galleries, and integrated booking logic, you can curate a welcoming and efficient space allocation system that reflects the soul of your land.

## Edit Listings Interface

The **Edit Listings** section offers a visual, card-based dashboard to manage your accommodation units. Each listing includes:

- **Name and Type** (e.g., *Private Glamping*, *Volunteer Dorm*)
- **Pricing Options** (Nightly, Weekly, Monthly)
- **Short Descriptions** with a preview of amenities or vibe
- **Images and Galleries** with scrollable thumbnails
- A prominent **Edit Listing** button for quick updates

Each card lets you quickly assess key details like price and capacity while giving you full control over how each listing is presented.

## Categories and Filters

On the left sidebar, coordinators can filter listings using intuitive tags such as:
- **Staff accommodation**
- **Volunteer housing**
- **Glamping**
- **Private or shared use**

This allows you to switch between different housing categories with ease—ideal for communities with dynamic spatial needs.

## Smart Pricing and Availability

Each unit supports multi-tiered pricing:
- Per night
- Per week
- Per month

This allows guests, volunteers, and stewards to choose what fits their budget while supporting your community’s financial sustainability.

## Seamless Integration with Bookings

The listings are tightly integrated with Closer’s booking tools:
- All stays are synced with the **Booking Calendar**.
- You can manage booking requests, see current guests, and avoid double-bookings.
- Listings marked for **internal use** (e.g., *Staff Accommodation*) are automatically filtered from public-facing pages.

## Descriptive and Visual

Every accommodation card allows you to:
- Upload multiple images (with carousel view)
- Write short, welcoming descriptions
- Display pricing transparently

This helps your listings feel warm and informative—especially for visitors who are new to regenerative living.

## Dynamic Layout for Community Evolution

Need to move someone mid-stay? You can manually adjust or reassign guests in seconds. The system is built for real-world flexibility—whether someone upgrades from dorms to a glamping tent or a steward reclaims a cabin.

## Future Capabilities

The Accommodation module will soon connect to:
- Cleaning and turnover alerts
- Maintenance logging
- Energy and water footprint dashboards per unit

By merging hospitality with ecological care, Closer ensures your housing system becomes a true part of your regenerative infrastructure.
