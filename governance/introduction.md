# Native Tokens & Governance: Integrating Closer's Web3 Functionality

At the heart of Closer's innovation is its approach to community governance and value exchange. The Native Tokens & Governance module leverages blockchain-based tools that enable transparent, participatory, and equitable decision-making while opening new opportunities for resource allocation and economic relationships. This system serves as a bridge between traditional community management and emerging decentralized methods—making it possible for communities to evolve their decision processes while remaining connected to the broader Web3 ecosystem.

## 1. Native Community Tokens

**What They Are:**  
Community tokens in Closer reimagine value, access, and belonging. Unlike conventional currencies that may extract value, our native tokens keep resources circulating within the community. They provide:

- **Access Rights:** Tokens can grant members special access to platforms or spaces.
- **Governance Weight:** The number of tokens held can determine voting power in decision-making.
- **Expressions of Belonging:** Tokens act as a symbol of membership and commitment to community values.

## 2. Proof of Presence

**Why It Matters:**  
Physical presence is crucial for land-based communities. The Proof of Presence system tracks and values the time members spend in the community space. This has two important effects:

- **Balanced Contributions:** It ensures that those who actively participate in day-to-day operations have a greater say in governance.
- **Encouragement to Participate:** By rewarding physical presence, it boosts engagement and strengthens community ties.

## 3. Proof of Sweat

**Recognizing Hands-On Contributions:**  
Proof of Sweat rewards members for their practical, hands-on contributions. Whether it's building, maintaining, or creatively contributing to community projects, Proof of Sweat:

- **Records Contributions Transparently:** Every effort is tracked and acknowledged.
- **Translates Into Governance:** Contributions can convert into additional governance weight, ensuring that active doers have an influential role.
- **Encourages Collaborative Work:** It fosters an environment where every member’s work is valued.

## 4. Governance Implementation

**How Decisions Are Made:**  
Closer’s governance tools support the full cycle of decision-making:
- **Proposal Creation:** Any member can propose new ideas or changes.
- **Deliberation:** Proposals are discussed openly—often via integrated forums.
- **Voting:** Voting is conducted using tools like Snapshot, where token weights determine influence.
- **Implementation Tracking:** Approved proposals are tracked from execution through review.

This system ensures that governance is inclusive, transparent, and dynamic.

## 5. Web3 Integration

Closer integrates seamlessly with leading Web3 tools to enhance governance and treasury management:

### Snapshot for Voting
- **Off-Chain Voting:** Members can vote on proposals without incurring gas fees.
- **Token-Weighted Votes:** Votes are weighted according to the tokens each member holds, ensuring fair participation.

### Safe for Treasury Management
- **Multi-Signature Security:** Treasury funds are stored in Safe (formerly Gnosis Safe), where multiple member signatures are needed to execute transactions.
- **Decentralized Control:** This increases security by preventing unilateral fund movements.

### Charmverse Forum for Proposal Discussions
- **Open Dialogue:** The Charmverse Forum provides a dedicated space for discussing governance proposals.
- **Community Feedback:** Members share ideas, feedback, and endorsements before proposals are submitted for voting.

### ERC20 and Beyond
- **Plug-and-Play Flexibility:** Closer’s stack is built to integrate with any ERC20-based logic. This means you can add additional tokens or Web3 tools from the Ethereum ecosystem as your community’s needs evolve.
