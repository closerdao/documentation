# $Presence

The $Presence token is designed as a measure of a user's physical presence in a Project.

$Presence is a Soulbound (non-transferrable) decayed\* ERC-20 token.

Contract parameters (DAO controlled):

* Rate of decay\* (default 10% per annum)
* Minter role woul

\*decay: in order to represent the loss of context a user would have from being absent in the land project, we give higher governance weight to more recent stays. \
\
Example:\
Decaying the $Presence by 10% per year would mean that after 5 years, instead of 100 initial $Presence received, 59 $Presence would be the updated balance.&#x20;

However, $Presence is also cumulative since you can keep staying in the property and earn more $Presence.&#x20;

Staying 5 years, 10 nights per year, would result in a total of (10 + 9 + 8.1 + 7.3 + 6.6 = ) 41.&#x20;

Staying 10 nights for 10 years, it would results in a total of (10 + 9 + 8.1 + 7.3 + 6.6 + 5.9 + 5.3 + 4.8 + 4.3 + 3.9 =) 65.&#x20;

Staying 10 nights for 100 years would result in a total of&#x20;
