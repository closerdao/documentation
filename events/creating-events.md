## Step 1: General Tab

In this initial step, you will:
- **Enter the Event Title:**  
  For example, "Tree Planting Weekend" or "Harmonia Spring Gathering".
  
- **Provide a Detailed Description:**  
  Use a rich-text editor to explain the agenda, objectives, or any special notes.
  
- **Set Virtual Options:**  
  Toggle whether the event is virtual. If so, additional fields (e.g., YouTube Recording URL) will appear.
  
- **Configure Booking Calendar Blocking:**  
  Choose whether this event should block the Booking Calendar from accepting other bookings during its timeframe.
  
- **Enter Event Location:**  
  Provide a physical address if the event is in-person, or indicate if itâ€™s exclusively virtual.
  
- **Set Visibility:**  
  Choose from Public, Custom (e.g., for select groups), Private, or Secret.
  
- **Define the Event Slug:**  
  Create a unique URL identifier (e.g., `harmonia-spring-2025`).

After filling in the General tab, click **Next** to move to ticket settings, or **Save** to retain the current information.

## Step 2: Tickets Tab

Here you set up the ticketing options:
- **Ticket Types:**  
  Define different ticket options like _General Admission_, _VIP_, or _Volunteer Ticket_.
  
- **Pricing and Quantities:**  
  Set a price (fiat or token-based) and a maximum number of tickets for each type.
  
- **Discounts and Early-bird Options:**  
  Optionally provide discount codes or automatic discounts for specific groups.
  
- **Day Tickets vs. Full Event Passes:**  
  For multi-day events, you can designate tickets for single days or the full event.

After configuring ticketing, proceed to the next tab if available or save your progress.

## Step 3: Advanced Tab

In this final step:
- **Set Event Date & Time:**  
  Specify the start and end date/time, which automatically categorizes the event as upcoming or past.
  
- **Additional Fields:**  
  Optionally enter a Participation Guide URL, event capacity, and any special partner or volunteer details.
  
- **Media Upload:**  
  Add a banner image or other visuals to represent the event.
  
- **Publish Options:**  
  Choose to publish immediately or schedule a future time for the event to go live.

Once complete, click **Publish** (or **Save**) to finalize your new event.
