# Events FAQ

This section provides answers to common questions regarding event creation, management, and ticketing in the Closer Platform.

**Q1: How are events categorized as upcoming or past?**  
A: Events are sorted based on their start and end date/time. Any event with a start date in the future or that is currently in progress is labeled as upcoming; once the end date passes, it moves to the past events section.

**Q2: How do I restrict event visibility?**  
A: Under the General tab during event creation (or editing), set the Visibility field to Public, Custom, Private, or Secret. For custom restrictions, specify the user groups or roles allowed to view the event.

**Q3: What does “Block the Booking Calendar” do?**  
A: Enabling this option during event creation prevents community members from making accommodation bookings during the event’s timeframe, ensuring that your resources are fully available for event participants.

**Q4: How can I offer discounted or free tickets for volunteers?**  
A: In the Tickets tab, create a ticket type labeled “Volunteer Ticket” (or similar) and set the price to zero or a discounted rate. You can also integrate volunteer data from the Work-based Stays module.

**Q5: How do I update event details if changes occur?**  
A: Use the “Edit Event” function on the event detail page. This returns you to the multi-step editing interface, where you can update the General, Tickets, or Advanced settings as needed.
