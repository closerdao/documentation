# Viewing & Editing an Event

After an event is created, you can view its details or edit its content. This functionality ensures that you can update event information, manage changes, or correct errors as needed.

## Viewing an Event

On the event detail page you will typically see:
- **Event Banner:**  
  A header image representing the event.
  
- **Basic Information:**  
  Date range, location, and host/organizer details.
  
- **Ticket Information:**  
  A summary of available ticket types, pricing, and availability.
  
- **Quick Action Buttons:**  
  Options such as “Edit Event” or “View Tickets”.

## Editing an Event

To modify an event:
1. **Click "Edit Event":**  
   This brings you to the same multi-tab interface (General, Tickets, Advanced) used for creation.
   
2. **Update Required Fields:**  
   Make the necessary adjustments such as changing the event date, updating the description, or modifying ticket quantities and pricing.
   
3. **Save Changes:**  
   Once all updates are applied, click **Save** or **Publish** to update the event live.

Ensure that any changes made do not conflict with other scheduled bookings or system settings.
