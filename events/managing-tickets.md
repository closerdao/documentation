# Managing Tickets

Effective ticket management is vital for ensuring that event attendance aligns with your planning. This section describes how to handle ticket configuration and participant tracking.

## Ticket Overview

On your event detail page, a **"View Tickets"** or **"Tickets"** button will display:
- **Ticket Types:**  
  Each category (e.g., General Admission, VIP, Volunteer Ticket) along with its price and remaining quantity.
  
- **Purchasing Process:**  
  Visitors can select a ticket type, input quantity, and proceed through a secure checkout flow.
  
- **Check-in Process:**  
  For in-person events, admins can mark tickets as used (i.e., check-in attendees).

## Admin Functions

- **Ticket Inventory Management:**  
  Adjust the number of tickets available if your capacity changes.
  
- **Discount Codes & Offers:**  
  Configure promotional codes or automatic discounts applicable to certain categories, such as volunteer tickets.
  
- **Reporting:**  
  Generate a report or export a list of ticket sales and check-in status for event analysis.

Maintaining detailed ticket data supports smooth event operations and provides critical insights for future planning.
